# bird-song-assessment
This is a game that I made for my university assessment, it's function is to produce sound when an image is clicked. I used a selection of tools that I had learnt over the 13 week program at the University. I decided I wanted to create a game that used these elements and then made it interactive. Within my other pieces of work for the University, I have addressed elements of Nature. Therefore, I focused on this idea as the body of my work. I created an audio file that is a delayed bird song. This bird song is only played when the user choses to click within the parameters of the image on the screen. 

The design focus of the game was to keep it simple, the imagery is centered and draws the majority of the attention to the task. I also chose to have the text more towards the left side as it add an element of formality and order to the game.
